üåê Inter-Campus Network Communication
Firstly Clear I focus more on Websites So its a Request to Check E8 and h11 campus websites
üìò Project Overview

This project designs and implements a secure **inter-campus communication system** for **Bahria University**, connecting its four major campuses:

1. Bahria University Islamabad (E-8 Campus)
2. Bahria University Islamabad (H-11 Campus)
3. Bahria University Lahore Campus
4. Bahria University Karachi Campus

Each campus includes 7 labs, each with **14 PCs**:

* Communication Lab
* Computing Lab
* Electrical Machines Lab
* Electronics Lab
* FYP Hardware Lab
* Embedded Systems Lab
* Control Systems Lab

Goal: Enable **same-lab communication across campuses** while **restricting cross-lab interaction**, with full administrative access via a centralized **Rector‚Äôs Computer**.

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies & Implementation

* **Routing Protocol:** RIP (Routing Information Protocol)
* **Network Segmentation:** VLANs
* **Security Enforcement:** Access Control Lists (ACLs)
* **Simulation Tools:** Cisco Packet Tracer / GNS3
* **Administrative Access:** Rector‚Äôs PC with full inter-campus control
* **Web Systems:** Campus-specific HTML websites with access restrictions


üí° My Main Contribution

I focused on **developing advanced, interactive, and responsive websites** for each campus using:

* **HTML5** ‚Äì structured content
* **CSS3** ‚Äì modern layouts, animations, and custom styling
* **JavaScript** ‚Äì dynamic features, access controls, and interactivity

Each website is tailored to its campus, accessible **only within its local lab environment**, and includes:

* Lab descriptions
* News or notices
* Restricted navigation
* Rector-accessible admin panel (optional)


‚úÖ Project Outcomes

* Fully segmented and simulated RIP-based network with inter-campus lab control
* Enforced lab-only communication through VLANs and ACLs
* Advanced, campus-specific web interfaces using modern frontend tech
* Proper network troubleshooting and testing for routing and access
